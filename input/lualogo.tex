\section{Design implementation using Lua scripting language}
After working on LibreCAD 3, I experimented with it by making some designs usign Lua scripting language which involes the concept of loops, conditional statements as well as functions.
\noindent In this project, I have made several lua scripts and run it on LibreCAD v3 to make various design. I have made design of water tank and various logos and some other impressive 2D design in LibreCAD using Lua scripting language. 
In LibreCAD v3, there is a dockable window for running lua scipts and the corresponding output is shown on the graphicscene which is main working window:
